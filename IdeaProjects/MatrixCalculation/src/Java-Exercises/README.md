<summary><strong>Exercise 1: Statistics of Grades</strong></summary>

`Complexity` : Beginner            `Time estimate` : 4 - 5hrs

### **Project Objectives:**

- Ability to create, initialize, and manipulate arrays to store data
- Proficiency in using conditional statements
- Understanding of string formatting techniques to display results in a clear and organized manner.
- Ability to analyze requirements and develop algorithms to solve the problem efficiently through the generation of a dynamic bar chart in the console.

### **Description:**

Write a program that reads the grades of  `N` students in a class on an assignment and stores them in an array `scores` of size N.

1. **Search for and display:**
   - the maximum grade of the class,
   - the minimum grade of the class,
   - the average grade of the class.
2. **From the students' `scores`, establish an array `stats` of size 5 which is composed as follows:**

   - stats[4] contains the number of grades above 80
   - stats[3] contains the number of grades from 61 to 80
   - stats[2] contains the number of grades from 41 to 60
   - ...
   - stats[0] contains the number of grades from 0 to 20

Create a bar graph representing the  `scores` array. Use the symbols `#######` for bar representation and display the grade range below the graph.

Sample input: (The student's grades vary from 0 to 100)

2 20 21 22 23 30 48 49 50 55 60 65 72 63 76 80 68 90 85 98
